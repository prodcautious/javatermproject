# Inventory Management System

Our group decided to use this design because it directly supports the goal outlined in our proposal of creating a practical inventory management system for businesses that handle multiple products. Using a HashMap for inventory storage allows fast and efficient item lookup, updates, and stock management, which is essential for warehouse and retail environments. We defined item identity using name and category so duplicate products are not created, making inventory easier to manage and more realistic. Sorting items by name or price allows users to quickly organize and analyze inventory, aligning with the proposal’s goal of counting and sorting products through a simple command-based interface. 

We chose this approach for the project because it demonstrates clear and appropriate use of abstract data types and algorithms covered in class while remaining scalable and easy to test. The Queue used for restocking models real-world workflows by ensuring items that run out first are restocked first, and unit testing helped confirm that core features work correctly. Overall, this implementation reflects the intent of our proposal while showing a strong understanding of data structures, algorithmic reasoning, and clean program organization.
